Q. Reason you applied for financial aid
A. I'm final-year student pursuing my B. Tech in Electronics and Communications Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee. I am deeply in need to advancing my skills in deep learning. 
Being from a middle-class family with a heavy financial burden due to institute fees, and having zero annual income, the cost of the course is beyond my current means. My mother is the only earning member of my family since father expired. She is a nurse with barely enough salary to support the education of the two children. By granting me financial aid, you would not only be supporting my educational aspirations but also contributing to the practical knowledge I bring to my future workplace. This investment in my education will not only benefit me personally but will also positively impact the projects and tasks I undertake in the field of deep learning. 
I am truly passionate about leveraging deep learning in my academic and professional pursuits, and I sincerely hope for your support in making this opportunity accessible to me.

Q. How will your selected course help with your goals?
A. I urgently need to enroll in this deep learning course on Coursera to enhance my skills and knowledge in the field. As a final-year B.Tech student majoring in Electronics and Communications Engineering at Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee, we are required to take a B. Tech Project (BTP) in the final year. In my project I'm required to train a deep learning model to predict existence of materials from the spectroscopic data of the moon surface taken by the Chandrayaan - 2 orbiter. The deep learning expertise gained from this course is crucial for successfully completing my B.Tech project, where I aim to incorporate advanced techniques. Furthermore, considering my future career in a company which I'm placed in heavily emphasizes on deep learning applications, mastering these skills is essential for my job. Unfortunately, the financial strain of heavy institute fees and a zero annual income make it impossible for me to afford the course without financial aid. Acquiring this knowledge is not only a personal academic goal but a strategic investment in my future career prospects. Your support in granting financial aid for this course would significantly contribute to my educational journey and future success in the field of deep learning.
